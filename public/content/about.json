  "description": "A highly motivated and aspiring AI researcher with a strong background in deep learning, quantum computing, and web development. Over the past year, I have gained extensive knowledge in web development using React, application development, and proficiency in 14 programming languages. I have also worked with PyTorch and large language models (LLMs), and have published a paper on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and LLMs. My aspiration is to solve real-world challenges such as cancer treatment, renewable energy, and longevity through AI and its integration with quantum physics systems, also known as Quantum AI. My current research interests involve exploring the potential of AI to transform various domains and create innovative solutions for a better future. Currently, I am an undergraduate physics student at the University of Dhaka, where I am focusing on understanding pure physics to understand the quantum realm and harness its power to bring the much-anticipated Quantum AI that could address humanity's greatest challenges.",
